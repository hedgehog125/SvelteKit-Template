(Normally I'd use a GNU license but I figured it's clearer this way that this template *doesn't* require you to open source the projects you make with it. The MIT license also does actually apply, this isn't a weird mix of it and a GNU, I'm just explaining my reasoning. (also, wow, this license is so much easier to add :/))
